All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter 2.

The code will look like the following:
```
std::for_each(v1.begin(), v1.end(),
[&mean, sum{0.0}, count{0}, text](const double& val)
mutable
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for every software developer looking to improve and update their C++ development skills. Both students and professionals will find this book useful as the examples are curated to match any area of expertise and are easily adaptable. At the same time, they don’t lose focus of the system specifics. A basic understanding of operating systems’ interfaces is a must along with experience in software development.
